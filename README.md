# Java Studies – Object-Oriented Programming Practice

This repository contains a collection of small Java applications (`Application14` to `Application31`) developed during my object-oriented programming studies.
Each folder represents an isolated console-based project focused on one or more OOP concepts and coding techniques.

## 📂 Applications Overview

| Application     | Main Topics & Concepts                                                                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application14   | Basic class structure, constructors, getters and setters.                                                  |
| Application15   | First use of `enum`; object instantiation (`Order`, `OrderStatus`) outside and in loops.                   |
| Application16   | Composition, `enum`, object instantiation using constructors and lists (`Worker`).                         |
| Application17   | Object relationships: `Post` and `Comment`. Focused on association between entities.                       |
| Application18   | Lists, `enum`, object composition (`Client`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Product`).                             |
| Application19   | Inheritance with `Account` superclass and subclasses (`SavingsAccount`, `BusinessAccount`). Lists and upcasting/downcasting in practice. |
| Application20   | Abstract class `Employee`, subclassing, and polymorphism. Usage of lists and conditional logic.            |
| Application21   | Inheritance and polymorphism with product types (`ImportedProduct`, `UsedProduct`). Lists and loop-based object instantiation. |
| Application22   | Abstract class `Shape`, polymorphism with area calculation. Use of `enum`, lists, and dynamic dispatch.     |
| Application23   | Polymorphism, abstract class `TaxPayer` with subclasses `Individual` and `Company`. List iteration, conditional tax calculation logic, and casting. |
| Application25   | Exception handling: try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions, and input validation.                           |
| Application26   | Advanced exception handling, multiple catch blocks, and creating custom exceptions.                        |
| Application27   | File manipulation: reading, writing, and handling files using Java I/O and try-with-resources.             |
| Application28   | Interfaces in Java: implementing interfaces and achieving abstraction.                                      |
| Application29   | Applying interfaces in different contexts with multiple implementations.                                   |
| Application30   | Interfaces with polymorphism, best practices, and real-world use cases.                                    |
| Application31   | Comparable interface: sorting objects, implementing `compareTo()` method for custom ordering.              |
| Application32   | Default methods in interfaces: extending interfaces without breaking existing implementations.             |

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Constructors, getters, and setters
- Enums (`enum`)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and method overriding
- Interfaces and default methods
- Comparable interface and object sorting
- Composition and association between objects
- Exception handling and custom exceptions
- File reading and writing (Java I/O)
- Upcasting and downcasting
- Object instantiation in different contexts
- Lists and loop structures (used in **all applications**)
- Conditional and structured logic

## 💻 Technologies Used
