# Java Studies – Object-Oriented Programming Practice

This repository contains a collection of small Java applications (`Application14` to `Application23`) developed during my object-oriented programming studies.
Each folder represents an isolated console-based project focused on one or more OOP concepts and coding techniques.

## 📂 Applications Overview

| Application     | Main Topics & Concepts                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application14  | Basic class structure, constructors, getters and setters.                               |
| Application15  | First use of `enum`; object instantiation (`Order`, `OrderStatus`) outside and in loops.|
| Application16  | Composition, `enum`, object instantiation using constructors and lists (`Worker`).      |
| Application17  | Object relationships: `Post` and `Comment`. Focused on association between entities.    |
| Application18  | Lists, `enum`, object composition (`Client`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Product`).          |
| Application19  | Inheritance with `Account` superclass and subclasses (`SavingsAccount`, `BusinessAccount`). Lists and upcasting/downcasting in practice. |
| Application20  | Abstract class `Employee`, subclassing, and polymorphism. Usage of lists and conditional logic. |
| Application21  | Inheritance and polymorphism with product types (`ImportedProduct`, `UsedProduct`). Lists and loop-based object instantiation. |
| Application22  | Abstract class `Shape`, polymorphism with area calculation. Use of `enum`, lists, and dynamic dispatch. |
| Application23  | Polymorphism, abstract class `TaxPayer` with subclasses `Individual` and `Company`. List iteration, conditional tax calculation logic, and casting. |

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Constructors, getters, and setters
- Enums (`enum`)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and method overriding
- Composition and association between objects
- Upcasting and downcasting
- Object instantiation in different contexts
- Lists and loop structures (used in **all applications**)
- Conditional and structured logic

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA (JetBrains Educational License)
