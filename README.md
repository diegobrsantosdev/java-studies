# Java Studies – Object-Oriented Programming Practice

This repository contains a collection of small Java applications (`Application14` to `Application31`) developed during my object-oriented programming studies.
Each folder represents an isolated console-based project focused on one or more OOP concepts and coding techniques.


# Java Practice - Key Concepts

## Key Concepts Practiced

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, objects, constructors, getters, and setters
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and method overriding
- Interfaces and default methods
- Composition and association between objects
- Upcasting and downcasting
- Object instantiation in different contexts
- Object relationships (e.g., `Post` and `Comment`, `Order` and `OrderItem`)

### Enums (`enum`)
- Using enums for status, types, and options
- Integrating enums with classes and lists

### Collections & Generics
- Lists, Sets, Maps
- Generic types for collections
- Iterating and manipulating collections
- Sorting with `Comparable` and `Comparator`

### Streams and Functional Programming
- Stream API and pipelines
- `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, and `collect`
- `forEach` and method references (`::`)
- Functional interfaces: `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`
- Lambdas and expression syntax
- Combining streams with collections

### Exception Handling
- Try-catch blocks and multiple catch
- Throwing exceptions and input validation
- Creating and using custom exceptions

### File I/O
- Reading and writing files with Java I/O
- Try-with-resources for safe file handling

### Conditional and Structured Logic
- If-else, switch-case
- Loops and iteration (for, while, enhanced for)
- Conditional logic in object lists

### Real-World Scenarios
- Applying OOP and collections in practical applications
- Using polymorphism and interfaces for flexible design
- Combining functional programming with collections for clean pipelines

## 💻 Technologies Used
